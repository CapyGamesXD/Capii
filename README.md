# Capii

This here is a simple piece of firmware for a Pi or similar device!

It uses Cog to display the program, which auto-updates with service workers! :D

To install it, simply run this command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CapyGamesXD/Capii/main/install.sh | bash
```

If you (understandably) want to see what this runs, it's all available at that URL above. :D

If there are any issues don't hesistate to log them!, please log them!
